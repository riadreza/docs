---

## Introduction
In this guide, we will walk through the steps to deploy Traefik, a popular open-source reverse proxy and load balancer, and configure it to work with Cloudflare for enhanced security and performance.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A server or virtual machine with Docker installed.
- A Cloudflare account with a domain configured.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Traefik.
## Step 1: Deploy Traefik with Docker
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the Traefik service:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
    services:       
      traefik:
        image: traefik:v2.5
        command:
          - "--api.insecure=true"
          - "--providers.docker=true"
          - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
          - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
          - "8080:8080" # Traefik dashboard
        volumes:
          - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
