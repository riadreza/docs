## What is Docker?  
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and its dependencies together, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.   
Docker enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications quickly and efficiently by using containers. It provides a consistent environment for applications, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations. Docker also offers tools for building, sharing, and orchestrating containers, making it a popular choice for modern application development and deployment.
## Getting Started with Docker  
To get started with Docker, follow these steps:
1. **Install Docker**: Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
2. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Docker is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   This command should display the installed Docker version.
