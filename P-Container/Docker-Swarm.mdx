## Introduction
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up and manage a Docker Swarm cluster.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Multiple machines (physical or virtual) with Docker installed.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and command line operations.

## Problem we face without orchestration
When managing multiple Docker containers across different hosts, several challenges arise:  
1. **Manual Deployment**: Deploying containers on each host manually is time-consuming and error-prone.
2. **Scaling Issues**: Scaling services up or down requires manual intervention on each host.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic evenly across containers is complex without built-in
    load balancing.
4. **Service Discovery**: Containers need to know how to find each other, which can be difficult
    without orchestration.
5. **Fault Tolerance**: If a container or host fails, there is no automatic recovery mechanism.
Docker Swarm addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform for deploying, scaling, and managing container
ized applications across a cluster of Docker hosts.
## Benifits of Docker Swarm
1. **Simplified Deployment**: Deploy services across multiple nodes with a single command.
2. **Health Checks**: Automatically monitor and restart unhealthy containers.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scale services up or down with simple commands.
4. **Built-in Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes traffic across containers.
5. **Service Discovery**: Built-in DNS-based service discovery for easy communication between containers.   
6. **High Availability**: Automatic failover and recovery of services in case of node failures.
7. **Rolling Updates**: Update services with zero downtime using rolling updates.
