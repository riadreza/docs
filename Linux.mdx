title: "Linux"
description: "Linux is an open-source operating system, which means anyone\
 can use it, tweak it, and share it freely. \
 Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux comes in many different flavors, \
 called “distributions” or distros, like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, \
 each with its own look, feel, and features. Testing 01 & test 02 \
 thank you"
